# Ragereport: Product Vision Frustration

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Context:** User expressed strong frustration about timeline accuracy, redundant visuals, and loss of intended detail in the Product Vision page.

## Trigger
- Confusion about removing the roadmap/commit history and losing the Elvis pilot item.
- Simplified Elvis prototype UI visual; user preferred the richer version.
- Operator stats imbalance (Andrew missing real metrics).
- Visual redundancy (stack cards vs visual systems) not properly synthesized.

## Impact
- User felt the narrative and detail were diluted.
- Risk of presenting inaccurate or incomplete strategic information.

## Proposed Prevention
- Use progressive disclosure instead of trimming content.
- Verify all timeline dates and milestones with explicit user confirmation.
- Preserve richer visual components unless explicitly told to simplify.
