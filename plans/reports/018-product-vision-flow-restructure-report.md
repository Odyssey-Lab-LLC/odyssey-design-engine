# Report: Product Vision Flow Restructure

## Summary
- Re-structured the Product Vision Intro page to follow the COMPANION narrative flow.
- Removed the redundant roadmap/visual-systems block and embedded visuals into their proper sections.
- Synthesized the architecture cards with short labels + hover-expanded detail, and added the Elvis prototype UI grid.
- Updated copy for Plasmic (front-end builder), Sanity (MCP CMS with Strapi note), and corrected $200k ARR references.
- Rebuilt Quest Log to match the commit-style visual treatment.

## Files Modified
