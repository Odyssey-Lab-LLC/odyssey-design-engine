## Marketing

This is where the magic happens. Ready to grow?

We’ll help your new site get found on Google. We’ll help get reviews from past clients + streamline collecting future reviews. Plus, key: we’ll run high-ROI (money-making) ads that reliably fill open spots on your calendar (at home or traveling) that aren’t already filled up with existing clients and your own leads from Instagram and the rest. Time to live the tattoo lifestyle you _know_ is possible.

## This Is How We Work

### Strategies

You have a unique style. Not just your art but personality, preferences, approach. Who you vibe with. One size doesn’t fit all. Our strategies help guide you and us to set up a system that works for YOU. To get you the work you want, where you want to do it, with the clients you want to do it for.

### Systems

We haven’t just been building sites and marketing online for long enough to attain mastery. We’ve been doing it for tattoo artists and studios successfully for the better part of a decade. We have it down to a science. Got killer tattoos to show off? Got some happy clients? Cool. That’s all we need.

### Outcomes

Tweak, refine, grow. You’ll have bookings. You’ll have us working for you relentlessly in pursuit of performance. Your rates, your schedule, getting more of the work you want to do as your style, skills, and interests evolve. We do our art, you do yours. With more freedom than ever before.

## What Our clients say

Working with Brandon has been invaluable to my business. Within a few short months my phone was off the hook, my business had increased substantially and I have had the ability to refer even more people to other artists at the tattoo shop. Everyone wins!

## About Us

Almost 10 years ago, tattoo collector, web designer, and digital marketer Brandon McPeak started applying what he knew from marketing tech startups in Austin to getting tattooers and shops booked. Luck would have it, his skills were what his first tattooer-turned-client needed: he went from working a shop to owning his own high-end studio in Austin less than two years after starting our work together.

Many years and successful projects later, Brandon started Rising Ink, a boutique digital agency for the tattoo industry. Mostly, it’s still him handling clients, writing copy, designing, running ads, and more. You’ll deal deal with him personally. He also pulls in other talent as helpful to **deliver reliable and top-tier performance marketing to all the shops and artists who know a good thing when they see it**.

Do you see it, too?

## Ready to Make Waves?

Forget: the stress of the Instagram grind; taking walk-ins with ideas that make no sense for your style—or even for a tattoo; compromising on what you want to do; accepting rates less than what you know you’re worth…

**This is tattoo marketing with actual results**. 🫰
