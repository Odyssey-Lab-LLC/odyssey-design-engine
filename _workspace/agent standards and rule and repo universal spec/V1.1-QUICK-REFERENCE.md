# Multi-Agent Governance Standard v1.1 - Quick Reference

**Status:** Production-ready ✅  
**Date:** January 3, 2026

---

## What Changed in v1.1

Four major enhancements to prevent coordination failures:

| Enhancement | What It Solves | How to Use |
|-------------|----------------|------------|
| **System File Hierarchy** | Files disagree, agents confused | Follow decision tree before updating any system file |
| **Version Synchronization** | Silent drift, stale references | Add YAML stamps, run sync check script |
| **Session Continuity** | Context loss across sessions | Create session handoffs for complex work |
| **Incident Management** | Panicked recovery, risky git operations | Follow 7-step protocol when updates break things |

## Essential Files (Start Here)

### For Understanding v1.1
1. **`V1.1-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md`** — What was built (this is fastest read)
2. **`V1.1-INTEGRATION-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`** — Complete validation & testing guide
3. **`MULTI-AGENT-STANDARD-V1.1-ADDITIONS.md`** — Full documentation of 4 new sections

### For Implementation
4. **`templates/`** — Updated templates with version stamps and cold start protocols
5. **`scripts/check-system-file-sync.py`** — Run before committing system file changes

### For Reference
6. **`multi-agent-governance-standard-v1.md`** — Main spec (needs v1.1 content integrated)

## Quick Start Checklist

### New Project (v1.1 from scratch)
- [ ] Copy `templates/` to project root
- [ ] Fill in [BRACKETS] with project details
- [ ] Integrate v1.1 additions into main spec
- [ ] Copy sync check script to `scripts/`
- [ ] Run `python scripts/check-system-file-sync.py` to test
- [ ] Start first session with cold start protocol

### Existing v1.0 Project (upgrade to v1.1)
- [ ] Read `V1.1-INTEGRATION-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`
- [ ] Add YAML front matter to all system files
- [ ] Update templates with cold start protocols
- [ ] Add system file hierarchy section to AGENTS.md
- [ ] Copy sync check script to `scripts/`
- [ ] Run sync check to validate
- [ ] Create `planning/sessions/` directory
- [ ] Update any in-progress handoffs

## The Three Critical Rules

### 1. Update Hierarchy (Prevents Conflicts)

**Before updating ANY system file:**

```
Is this about agent coordination/roles/workflows?
├─ YES → Update AGENTS.md FIRST, then propagate
└─ NO → Is it agent/IDE-specific?
    ├─ YES → Update [AGENT].md only
    └─ NO → Is it technical design?
        ├─ YES → Update ARCHITECTURE.md
        └─ NO → Update README.md (external-facing)
```

### 2. Version Sync (Prevents Drift)

**Before committing system file changes:**

```bash
python scripts/check-system-file-sync.py
```

If errors: Update `synced_with` fields or resolve mismatches.

### 3. Cold Start Protocol (Prevents Context Loss)

**Every new agent session MUST read in this order:**

1. [AGENT].md (this agent's role)
2. AGENTS.md (team coordination)
3. README.md (project overview)
4. ARCHITECTURE.md (technical design)
5. .rules/ (technical standards)
6. planning/sessions/ (check for recent session handoffs)

**Plus:** Verify version sync before proceeding.

## Common Scenarios

### "I need to update agent roles"
→ Update AGENTS.md first (PRIMARY source)  
→ Then check if agent-specific files need sync  
→ Run sync check script  
→ Document in completion report

### "Version mismatch detected"
→ Read both file versions  
→ Decide: update synced_with or update dependency  
→ Test after change  
→ Run sync check to verify

### "Starting new session"
→ Check planning/sessions/ for recent handoffs  
→ Read most recent if < 7 days old  
→ Follow cold start protocol  
→ Load state from session handoff  
→ Proceed with work

### "System file update broke something"
→ Create planning/INCIDENT_ACTIVE.md flag  
→ Create incident report in planning/incidents/  
→ Don't git revert (manual rollback instead)  
→ Fix via handoff (not direct edit)  
→ Test thoroughly  
→ Create post-mortem in lessons

### "Completing complex session"
→ Create session handoff in planning/sessions/  
→ Capture decisions, gotchas, state  
→ Link to active handoffs  
→ Note what next session should do  
→ Include version sync status

## Integration Points (How It All Fits)

```
Version Stamps
    ↓ enable
Automated Conflict Detection (sync script)
    ↓ prevents
Version Mismatches
    ↓ which cause
Silent Drift

Update Hierarchy
    ↓ prevents
File Conflicts
    ↓ which cause
Inconsistent Agent Behavior

Cold Start Protocol
    ↓ optimized by
Session Handoffs
    ↓ which preserve
Context Across Sessions

Incident Management
    ↓ uses
Handoff Protocol
    ↓ which generates
Lessons Learned
```

**Every pattern reinforces the others.**

---

## Key Commands

```bash
# Check version synchronization
python scripts/check-system-file-sync.py

# Create session handoff (manual - use template)
cp templates/session-handoff.md.template planning/sessions/[agent]-[date]-[id].md

# Check for recent session handoffs
ls -lt planning/sessions/ | head -n 5

# Find system files that reference AGENTS.md
grep -r "AGENTS.md" *.md .cursor/rules/ .kilocode/rules/
```

## When to Use Each Protocol

| Protocol | Trigger | Frequency |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Cold Start** | Every new agent session | Every session |
| **Version Sync Check** | Before committing system files | Before every commit |
| **Update Hierarchy** | Before updating any system file | Every system file update |
| **Session Handoff** | Complex session >2hrs with state | As needed |
| **Incident Management** | System file update breaks things | Rare (if following other protocols) |

---

## Success Indicators

**v1.1 is working if:**

- ✅ No "which file do I trust?" confusion
- ✅ Version mismatches caught before they cause issues
- ✅ Agents resume work smoothly across sessions
- ✅ Incidents managed calmly, not panicked
- ✅ Context loading is fast and complete

**Ultimate measure:** New agent joins, zero human guidance needed → works correctly.

## Where to Get Help

### I need more detail on [topic]
→ Read `MULTI-AGENT-STANDARD-V1.1-ADDITIONS.md` for full documentation

### I want to test before deploying
→ Read "Testing Recommendations" in `V1.1-INTEGRATION-VALIDATION-REPORT.md`

### I want to understand the architecture
→ Read "Integration Architecture Validation" in validation report

### I want to see examples
→ Every section in ADDITIONS file has examples

### Something isn't working
→ Check quality gates in validation report
→ Run sync check script
→ Review integration points
