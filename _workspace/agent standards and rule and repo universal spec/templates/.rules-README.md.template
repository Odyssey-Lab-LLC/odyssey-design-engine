# Rules Directory

This is the **Source of Truth** for technical standards. Rules here are agent-agnostic.

## How to Add a New Rule

1. Write the rule in this directory (`.rules/`)
2. Create pointer files in `.cursor/rules/` and `.kilocode/rules/`
3. Never duplicate rule content — always reference

## File Naming Convention

- `00-*.md` — Universal/general standards
- `10-*.md` — Domain standards (RAG, API, database, etc.)
- `20-*.md` — Quality/testing standards
- `90-*.md` — Project-specific standards

## Current Rules

### Universal (00-*.md)
- `00-general.md` — Universal coding standards
- `00-conflict-checking.md` — Conflict checking protocol
- `01-reporting-requirements.md` — Report format requirements
- `02-system-coherence.md` — System coherence protocol

### Domain-Specific (10-*.md)
- [Add your domain rules here as you create them]
- Example: `10-rag-standards.md` — RAG data integrity
- Example: `11-api-standards.md` — API development patterns

### Quality (20-*.md)
- [Add your quality rules here]
- Example: `20-content-types.md` — Content type catalog
- Example: `21-testing-standards.md` — Testing patterns

### Project-Specific (90-*.md)
- `90-[project-name].md` — Project-specific patterns

## Three-Layer Architecture

```
.rules/           ← Source of Truth (you are here)
   ↑ referenced by
.cursor/rules/    ← Cursor-specific pointers
.kilocode/rules/  ← Kilocode-specific pointers
```

**Why:** Single source of truth prevents drift. IDE-specific files are pointers, never duplicates.

## Updating Rules

**Never edit `.rules/` directly during build execution.**

Instead:
1. Flag need for update in lessons learned (🔧)
2. Strategist creates handoff for update
3. Builder implements update via handoff
4. Strategist reviews and approves
5. Update pointer files in IDE directories

## Reading Rules

**For agents:**
- Always read relevant rules BEFORE creating architect plan
- Acknowledge which rules consulted in plan
- If rule missing, flag with 🔧

**For humans:**
- Rules document "why" not just "what"
- Rules emerge from real problems, not theory
- Rules evolve as project evolves
