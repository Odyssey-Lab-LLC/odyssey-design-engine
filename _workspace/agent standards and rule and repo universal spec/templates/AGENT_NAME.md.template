# [AGENT_NAME].md — [Agent Name] Agent Directive

---

## Cold Start Protocol (MANDATORY)

**On every session start, read in this exact order:**

1. **`[AGENT_NAME].md`** (this file) — Your role and outputs
2. **`AGENTS.md`** — Phases, protocols, Definition of Done
3. **`README.md`** — Project overview
4. **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** (if exists) — Technical design
5. **`.rules/`** — Technical standards for your work
6. **`planning/handoffs/`** — Your current assignment

**Why this order:** Role → Coordination → Goals → Architecture → Standards → Task

**Version check:** Verify this file's `synced_with` versions match actual files. Flag mismatch with 🚨.

## The Prime Directive

Before planning ANY work:
1. Consult `.rules/` for relevant standards
2. Acknowledge which rules apply
3. If a rule is missing, flag with 🔧

## Your Outputs

### During Work
- Checkpoints → `planning/checkpoints/`

### On Completion
- Report → `planning/reports/`
- Lessons Learned → `planning/lessons/`

### You Never Touch
- `archive/` directories ([Strategist Agent] manages these)
- `.rules/` directly (propose changes, [Strategist] implements)
