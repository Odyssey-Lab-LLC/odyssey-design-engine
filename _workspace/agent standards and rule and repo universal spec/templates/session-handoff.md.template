# Session Handoff Template

**Instructions:** Use this template for `planning/sessions/[AGENT]-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[NNN].md` where NNN is the session number for that day.

```yaml

agent: [Agent Name]
session_id: "[YYYY-MM-DD]-[NNN]"
previous_session: "[YYYY-MM-DD]-[NNN]"  # or null if first session
next_session: null  # filled by next session

# Session Handoff: [Agent Name] [YYYY-MM-DD]-[NNN]

## Session Summary

[2-3 sentences capturing the essence of what was accomplished in this session. Keep it high-level.]

Example: "Completed Phase 2 extraction for themes 15-22. Discovered unexpected variation in blend descriptions requiring manual review. Made decision to use 8-char hashes instead of 6-char due to collision risk."

## Context to Preserve

**Decisions made this session:**

1. **[Decision title]** — Rationale: [why this decision was made, what alternatives were considered]
2. **[Decision title]** — Rationale: [why]
3. **[Decision title]** — Rationale: [why]

**Patterns observed:**

- [Pattern discovered during work - e.g., "Theme definitions are 100% universal across all people"]
- [Pattern - e.g., "'Why unique' paragraphs have ~40% sharing rate"]
- [Pattern - e.g., "Blend descriptions vary more than expected"]

**Gotchas discovered:**

- [Edge case or trap - e.g., "PDF page numbers don't match extraction page numbers (off by 2)"]
- [Gotcha - e.g., "Hash collisions possible with 6-char prefix"]
- [Gotcha - e.g., "Bernie Progio has unique report format - handle separately"]

**Insights:**

- [Understanding gained - e.g., "Horizontal-first extraction 2x faster than vertical"]
- [Insight - e.g., "Version sync catching real issues early"]

## Handoff to Next Session

[One paragraph summary for next session agent reading this cold]

Example: "This session focused on Phase 2 extraction validation. Found blend descriptions vary more than expected - some need manual review (flagged in _work/review-needed.json). Decision made to use 8-char hashes. Handoff 012 is 75% complete, ready for Phase 3. Handoff 013 blocked waiting for user decision on caching strategy. System files updated to v1.3.0 and all in sync. Next session should complete 012 before starting anything new."
