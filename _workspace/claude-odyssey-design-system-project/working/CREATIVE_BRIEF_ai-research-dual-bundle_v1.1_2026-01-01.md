# CREATIVE BRIEF: AI Research Dual Bundle
## Handoff Routing for Next Claude Instance

**Version**: 1.1  
**Status**: Ready for Handoff  
**Date**: 2026-01-01

---

## OVERVIEW: WHAT YOU'RE BUILDING

**Three Odyssey artifacts**:
1. Hub/Portal - Synthesis, dual perspective, navigation
2. Risks Report - Cognitive degradation, warning signs, practices
3. Opportunities Report - EPOCH, capability enhancement, IA principles

**Source**: ~90KB research (Vector Portal + two reports) â†’ visual experiences

**Constraint**: 100% content preservation (add layers, never remove depth)

**Audience**: Small team knowledge workers + partners/investors + Odyssey team + Brandon

---

## VIBE (CRYSTALLIZED)

### Titans vs Pantheon Mythology

**Risks** = Titans realm (grounded, bronze, stone, weighted wisdom)  
**Opportunities** = Pantheon realm (elevated, gold, sky, aspirational growth)  
**Hub** = Portal/threshold (Light/Dark blend, gateway between realms)

**Mythology dial**: Blended moderate (form language + symbolic elements, NO literal imagery)

**Quality bar**: Museum exhibit sophistication, NOT theme park spectacle

**Full visual details**: Creative Plan Part 2 + Part 6

---

## STRUCTURAL DECISIONS (RESOLVED)

**Hub**: Balanced narrative (key insights â†’ path cards â†’ accordions for depth)  
**Reports**: Reorganized for learning (hero's journey arc)  
**Navigation**: Sticky bottom nav (Pattern 1 from Concept Module)  
**Depth**: Accordions with informative headers (Pattern 3 from Concept Module)

**Full skeletons**: Creative Plan Part 5 (MECE tree charts, all three pages)

---

## EXECUTION APPROACH

### Agent Assignment

**Gemini**: All heroes + key visuals (portal, EPOCH cards, timeline, Four-Zone diagram)  
**Claude** (you): Content specs + structure + preservation verification + Gemini handoff prep

**Build sequence**: Reports first â†’ Hub emerges from reports

**Strategy details**: Creative Plan Part 4

---

## YOUR WORKFLOW (Next Claude)

1. **Load source materials** (5 files listed in YAML above)
2. **Read Creative Plan** (~30 min, full context)
3. **Create content specifications** (3 pages, use skeletons from Plan Part 5)
4. **Prepare Gemini handoffs** (3 files, use Template + visual ideas from Plan Part 6)
5. **Present to Brandon** for approval before Gemini execution

**Mode**: `/noq` creative director - execute with assumptions, flag gaps

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA (QUICK CHECK)

- [ ] 100% research content preserved
- [ ] Odyssey tokens used (no hardcoded values)
- [ ] Titans/Pantheon aesthetic evident (tasteful)
- [ ] Navigation + accordions functional
- [ ] Hero's journey flow clear
- [ ] Gemini outputs audited (content + visual quality)

**Full checklist**: Creative Plan Part 8

---

## SOURCE MATERIAL ROUTING

**All files in `/mnt/project/`**:

1. **VECTOR_PORTAL** - Hub source (synthesis, meta-awareness)
2. **RESEARCH_REPORT_ai-ops-risks** - Risks source (42KB)
3. **RESEARCH_REPORT_ai-opportunities** - Opportunities source (41KB)
4. **SYSTEM_odyssey-design-tokens_v0.3** - Design system (ALWAYS load first)
5. **CONCEPT_SYSTEM_MOD_pattern-emergence_v0.1** - Visual patterns reference

**Handoff pair**:
- This brief (overview/routing)
- **CREATIVE_PLAN_ai-research-dual-bundle_v1_2026-01-01.md** (FULL DEPTH - read this next)

---

## DECISIONS FROM ALIGNMENT

**All 5 alignment questions resolved** (captured in Creative Plan):
- Hub: Balanced approach
- Heroes: Gemini for all + key visuals
- Mythology: Blended moderate
- Depth: Reorganize for learning
- Flow: Sectioned nav with sticky bottom

**Rationale for each**: See Creative Plan Part 3

---

## VERSION HISTORY

**v1.0** (2026-01-01): Initial after meditation  
**v1.1** (2026-01-01): Direction crystallized, ready for handoff
- All decisions resolved
- Creative Plan created (full depth)
- Concept Module integrated
- Status: Ready for next Claude instance
