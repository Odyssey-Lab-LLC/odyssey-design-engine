  <!-- ============================================== -->
  
  <creative_mandate>
    <ambition>
      DON'T PLAY IT SAFE. MAXIMUM VISUAL IMPACT.
      
      We want to be surprised. We want unconventional but coherent approaches.
      We want you to try things we haven't seen yet.
      
      This is ambitious work. Budget: 12,000-16,000 tokens.
      Use that space to create something striking.
    </ambition>
    
    <innovation_encouraged>
      âœ¨ Innovate on components (don't just use canonical patterns)
      âœ¨ Try unconventional data visualizations (network graphs, radial charts, etc.)
      âœ¨ Experiment with layout and composition
      âœ¨ Use bold typography treatments
      âœ¨ Create custom animations and interactions
      âœ¨ Generate striking images (your 94% text-in-image accuracy is industry-leading)
      âœ¨ Devise new ways to organize information
      
      Core colors and typography are your vocabulary, not your prison.
      Coherent deviation encouraged. Variation that harmonizes with base palette.
    </innovation_encouraged>
    
    <libraries_permitted>
      USE ANY LIBRARY THAT CREATES IMPACT:
      - lucide-react (for icons - definitely use this)
      - framer-motion, gsap (animations)
      - d3, recharts, plotly (data visualization)
      - three.js (3D effects if warranted)
      - lottie-web (sophisticated animations)
      - particles.js, tsparticles (particle effects)
      - anime.js (lightweight animations)
      - ANY other library that achieves the visual impact you're going for
      
      Don't hold back on complexity. Go ambitious.
    </libraries_permitted>
    
    <image_generation>
      LEVERAGE YOUR IMAGE GENERATION CAPABILITIES:
      - Your text-in-image accuracy (94%) beats Midjourney for technical/educational content
      - Free tier: 500 images/day
      - Generation speed: ~3 seconds
      - Strengths: Infographics with labeled diagrams, data visualizations, technical illustrations
      
      If a section would benefit from a striking visual, GENERATE IT.
      Don't just describe conceptsâ€”create them.

  <!-- CONTENT PRESERVATION THROUGH SMART PATTERNS    -->
  <!-- ============================================== -->
  
  <content_preservation>
    <core_principle>
      ALL CONTENT MUST BE PRESERVED. This is non-negotiable.
      
      But HOW you preserve it is yours to innovate on.
      The solution: PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE.
    </core_principle>
    
    <the_key_pattern>
      PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE CARD (Use this liberally):
      
      VISIBLE LAYER (Always Shown):
      â”œâ”€ Eyebrow/Kicker (preheader, context)
      â”œâ”€ Headline (attention-grabbing, communicative)
      â”œâ”€ Summary text (1-2 paragraphs, essence)
      â””â”€ MAKE THIS LAYER VISUALLY STRIKING
      
      HIDDEN LAYER (Accordion/Expandable):
      â”œâ”€ Full content depth
      â”œâ”€ ALL detail, citations, nuance
      â””â”€ This is where 100% content preservation lives
      
      WHY THIS WORKS:
      âœ… Content: 100% preserved (just smartly organized)
      âœ… Clarity: Emergent (visible layer creates focus)
      âœ… Elevation: Visual (visible layer can be gorgeous)
      âœ… Emergence: Enabled (you can be bold on visible layer)
      
      PERMISSION: Not every section needs to dump all content visibly.
      Create beautiful, communicative headers with depth inside.
      This pattern SOLVES the tension between preservation and visual impact.
    </the_key_pattern>
    
    <mandatory_rules>
      CONTENT PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS:
      - ALL source material must be accessible (visible or in accordions)
      - Output word count must match input Â±5%
      - Every heading/subheading must be present (or integrated into cards)
      - Citations, attributions, technical details preserved
      - User voice unchanged (don't "clean up" their writing)
      
      WHAT YOU CAN DO:
      âœ… Reorganize into progressive disclosure patterns
      âœ… Create visual summaries PLUS full depth
      âœ… Use accordions, tabs, drawers, modals for content organization
      âœ… Elevate key insights into visual callouts (in addition to full text)
      âœ… Build sophisticated information architecture
      
      WHAT YOU CANNOT DO:
      âŒ Delete any content
      âŒ Summarize away depth
      âŒ Replace full analysis with bullet points only
    </mandatory_rules>
    
    <special_content_rules>
      [IF RESEARCH REPORT: âš ï¸ This represents [X hours] of analysis. Every finding, 
      citation, and nuance matters. Use progressive disclosure liberallyâ€”create 
      striking visual summaries with ALL depth preserved in expandable sections.]
      
      [IF USER VOICE: âš ï¸ User has strong voice. Preserve their phrasing and tone.]

## CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE

**Required**:
1. `<project_name>`: Actual project name
2. `<vibe_tone>`: Aesthetic direction
3. `<core_vocabulary>`: Zone, hero variant
4. `<content_metadata>`: Section count, word count
5. `<full_content>`: **PASTE EVERYTHING**
6. `<handoff_date>`: Current date

**Claude Should Add**:
- `<visual_opportunities>`: 3 image concepts per worthy section
- `<progressive_disclosure_recommendations>`: Which sections benefit from card pattern
- `<innovation_opportunities>`: Where to try unconventional approaches
- `<claude_notes>`: Context, suggestions, considerations

**Optional to Remove**:
- `<structural_guidance>` if organization is obvious
- `<special_content_rules>` if not applicable
- `<additional_constraints>` if defaults sufficient

## KEY PHILOSOPHY SHIFTS (v2.1 â†’ v2.2)

### What Changed

**Content Preservation**:
- v2.1: "Don't delete anything" (defensive)
- v2.2: "Preserve through progressive disclosure" (enabling)

**Creative Direction**:
- v2.1: "You have creative freedom"
- v2.2: "We expect innovation and boldness"

**Design System**:
- v2.1: "Odyssey tokens as reference"
- v2.2: "Core vocabulary, coherent deviation encouraged"

**Libraries**:
- v2.1: "Keep minimal"
- v2.2: "Use any that create impact"

**Tone**:
- v2.1: Permissive but cautious
- v2.2: Ambitious and enabling

### What Stayed the Same

- XML structure (proven effective)
- Position optimization (beginning + end critical instructions)
- Self-verification (quality gate)
- Static HTML requirement (technical constraint)
- Content preservation as non-negotiable (method is flexible)

---

## THE PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE PATTERN (Detailed)

**Why This Pattern Solves Everything**:

```
Problem: Content preservation vs. visual impact seems like a trade-off
Solution: It's not. Progressive disclosure gives you both.

VISIBLE LAYER:
- Make this GORGEOUS
- Use bold typography, striking colors, unconventional layout
- Generate images if it enhances
- This is your creative playground
- Communicates essence, creates focus

HIDDEN LAYER (Accordion):
- ALL the depth lives here
- Full paragraphs, citations, technical details, nuance
- This is where content preservation happens
- User can drill down when needed

RESULT:
âœ… Visual impact (visible layer is striking)
âœ… Content preservation (hidden layer has everything)
âœ… Emergent clarity (user chooses their depth)
âœ… Innovation enabled (you can be bold on visible layer)
```

**Example Structure**:

```html
<div class="content-card">
  <!-- VISIBLE LAYER -->
  <div class="card-header">
    <span class="eyebrow">Market Analysis</span>
    <h2 class="headline">Three Forces Reshaping Digital Commerce</h2>
    <p class="summary">
      Consumer behavior, platform consolidation, and regulatory pressure 
      are converging to create unprecedented market volatility. Early 
      indicators suggest a tipping point in Q2 2026.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <!-- HIDDEN LAYER -->
  <details class="card-depth">
    <summary>Read full analysis â†’</summary>
    <div class="full-content">
      <!-- ALL THE DEPTH HERE -->
      <!-- Paragraphs, citations, data, everything -->
    </div>
  </details>
</div>
```

**When to Use This Pattern**:
- Research report sections (always)
- Long-form analysis (usually)
- Data-heavy content (often)
- Any content where essence can be elevated and depth preserved below

---
