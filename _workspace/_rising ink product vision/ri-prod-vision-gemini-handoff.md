## 👋 GREETINGS, CO-PILOTS

I have been working with the human operator to define the visual soul and strategic arc of the **Rising Ink / Elvis Pitch**. My role was "Creative Director"—generating visual concepts, component ideas, and aesthetic rules. 

**Your role is "Lead Architect."** You need to take these disparate code blocks and visual concepts and stitch them into a cohesive, single-page scroll that tells the story defined in the `COMPANION` file.

**I am doing my best to convey the vision below, but please treat this as guidance, not rigid law. You are closer to the code. If a transition feels janky, fix it. If the DOM is heavy, optimize it.**

## 🧩 THE ARCHITECTURE (How the pieces fit)

We are combining two distinct phases of work. You will need to merge them.

### 1. THE HEAD (The V1 Hero)
**Source:** The first code artifact generated (React/Tailwind with "Diamond Grid" & "Secret Weapon").
**Instruction:** * Preserve the **visual mechanics** of this section (the spinning watermark, the diamond grid, the kinetic typography overlay).
* **Aesthetic:** This sets the "Neo-Japanese / Structure" tone.
* **Update:** Ensure the text aligns with the "Inflection Point" concept if the user requests it, but keep that bold, overlapping layout logic.

### 2. THE BODY (The "Visual Component Kit")
**Source:** The subsequent prompts generated for diagrams and UI.
**Instruction:** These are the "Anchor Points" of the narrative. You should place them as follows, based on the `COMPANION` outline:

* **Section 1 (Who We Are):** Insert **"The Operator Cards"** (Brandon/Andrew stats).
* **Section 2 (What We've Built):** Insert **"The HighLevel Ecosystem"** (Network Graph).
* **Section 3 (Elvis Project):** Insert **"The Elvis Stack Bento"** (Sanity/Plasmic/Astro cards) AND **"The Elvis Prototype UI"** (The filterable tattoo grid).
* **Section 4 (Strategy):** Insert **"The Agency-to-Product River"** (Process flow pipe).
* **Section 6/9 (Roadmap):** Insert **"The Quest Log"** (Vertical Git-style timeline).

### 3. THE GLUE (Filling the Gaps)
There are text sections in the `COMPANION` file (like "The Thesis" or "The Bootstrap Alternative") that don't have specific visual components yet.
**Guidance for generating these:**
* **Vibe:** "Ancient Future."
* **Typography:** Use `Lemon Milk` (or wide sans) for headers, `JetBrains Mono` for data/captions, `Manrope` for body text.
* **Colors:** strict adherence to Charcoal (`#1A1A1A`), Paper Beige (`#ECE9E2`), and Ink Red (`#C1272D`).
* **Container Style:** Do not just dump text on a background. Use "Data Cards" or "Terminal Windows" to hold the copy. Keep it scannable.

## 🎨 VISUAL PRINCIPLES (If you need to generate new UI)

If you need to invent a component on the fly, use these principles:

1.  **Light/Dark Rhythm:** The Hero is DARK. The Strategy section might be LIGHT (Beige paper texture). The Tech section goes back to DARK. Create contrast between sections.
2.  **Progressive Disclosure:** Do not wall-of-text the user. Hide deep details (like the Figma Checklist from the Research Report) inside accordions or hover states.
3.  **The "Ink" Motif:** Use Red (`#C1272D`) sparingly but aggressively. It is the "Action Color."

## ⚠️ FINAL CAVEAT

I have provided the "what" and the "look," but you own the "how." 
* If the animations conflict, simplify them.
* If the file size gets too big, refactor.
* **The Narrative is King:** Ensure the story flows logically from "Here is who we are" to "Here is the tech" to "Here is the invitation."

Good luck, Agent. Build something that makes them say "Holy shit."
