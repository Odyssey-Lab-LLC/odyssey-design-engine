## SECTION 1: WHO WE ARE & WHAT WE'RE BUILDING

**VISUAL CONCEPT 1: "The Agency-to-Product Playbook" - Hero Graphic**

```
[DIAGRAM WIREFRAME]
Top: "Traditional Path" (in gray/muted)
- Raise capital → Build product → Find customers → Iterate
- YC bootcamp → Give equity to investors → Hope for product-market fit

Bottom: "Our Path" (in vibrant colors)
- Build niche agency → Get paid to learn market → A/B test with real clients
- → Build product clients already want → Scale with service revenue
- → Sell agencies (keep codebase) → Agencies become product customers

Center callout: "Bootstrap with $1M+ revenue while building"
```

**Slide Content:**

### The Thesis: Pro Services as Competitive Moat

**Background Context:**
- Brandon: ~10 years at B2B tech companies in Austin
  - B2B motherboard company (Marketing Manager)
  - E-commerce platform (Tech Support → Marketing Services Division)
  - B2B cloud contact center/omnichannel communications solution
- Common playbook observed: Pro services divisions generate revenue + make products sticky
- **The difference:** Most do it for adoption, not market intelligence
- **Our approach:** Use services to deeply understand market, A/B test solutions, get paid for R&D

**What Makes This Powerful:**
- Real-world validation before building product
- Customers fund development
- No theoretical feature debates - build what's proven
- Industry expertise becomes competitive moat

**The Tattoo Industry Focus (10 Years Deep):**
- Started 2014/2015 freelancing for tattoo artist clients
- Built first site → SEO → Google Ads → helped artist open private studio
- Became business partners in tattoo aftercare company
- Continuous A/B testing: automation workflows, digital waivers, nurture sequences, site architecture, content, copy
- **Not theory - battle-tested systems**

```
[TIMELINE + MATH VISUALIZATION]

Product: $2,000/month recurring for solo tattoo artists
Delivery: 20-30 hours total (websites are sophisticated, but process is streamlined)

GROWTH PROJECTION:
Month 1: 5 clients = $10K MRR
Month 2: 10 clients = $20K MRR
Month 3: 15 clients = $30K MRR
Month 4: 25 clients = $50K MRR
Month 5: 35 clients = $70K MRR
Month 6 (Summer): 40 clients = $80K MRR = ~$1M ARR

Visual callout: "40 sales by summer = $1M annual revenue"
Bottom note: "This is NEW revenue on top of existing business"
Additional note: "Conservative math - actual pricing will increase as demand validates"
```

**Slide Content:**

### The Immediate Opportunity: Scaling to $1M ARR

**The Productized Service:**
- **Target:** Solo tattoo artists (not shops - more on this next slide)
- **Price:** $2,000/month recurring
- **Delivery time:** 20-30 hours per client (sophisticated sites, streamlined process)

**VISUAL CONCEPT 4: "Why Solo Artists, Not Shops?"**

```
[COMPARISON TABLE - VISUAL TREATMENT]

SOLO ARTISTS vs TATTOO SHOPS

SOLO ARTISTS:
✅ Decision maker = service provider (simple)
✅ Revenue $1K-3K per day (high-value clients)
✅ 1:1 relationship (direct)
✅ Tech setup straightforward
✅ Industry trend: moving to private studios
✅ Easier to get booked solid
✅ Single creative vision
✅ Faster sales cycle

TATTOO SHOPS:
❌ Shops don't tattoo - artists do (complex product)
❌ Artists are contractors, not employees
❌ Shop owner margin on artists is low
❌ Artist politics and preferences vary widely
❌ 10x more complex to serve
❌ Slower decision-making
❌ Multiple stakeholders
❌ Higher setup requirements

Bottom note: "Shops ARE in the roadmap - but as Phase 2 after solo artist systems proven and scaled"
```

**Slide Content:**

### Strategic Focus: Solo Artists First

**The Industry Shift:**
- High-end tattoo artists increasingly opening private studios
- Artists charging $1K-3K+ per day
- More artist-centric industry (not shop-centric)
- Solo artists have cleaner business model and faster decisions

**Why Solo > Shops (Right Now):**
- **Decision-making:** Artist = decision maker = service provider (1:1)
- **Complexity:** 10x simpler than shops (artists at shops are contractors with varying preferences)
- **Economics:** Shop owner margin on artists is low, artists have direct revenue
- **Tech setup:** Straightforward for one artist vs. complex multi-artist systems
- **Sales cycle:** Faster, less politics

**Future State:** 
- Shops are definitely part of roadmap (we have 2 on HighLevel now)
- But start with scalable, proven, simple model
- Build shop features after solo artist product proven

**VISUAL CONCEPT 7: "The Agency-to-Product Playbook (Detailed)"**

```
[PROCESS FLOW DIAGRAM]

STAGE 1: Build Niche Agency
→ Deep expertise in one vertical
→ A/B test everything with real clients
→ Get paid to do market research
→ Understand pain points intimately

STAGE 2: Create Productized Service
→ Systematize what works
→ Remove custom work
→ Prove unit economics
→ Scale to $1M+ revenue

STAGE 3: Extract Platform
→ Identify common patterns
→ Build modular system
→ White-label components
→ API-first architecture

STAGE 4: Sell Agencies, Keep Code
→ Agency becomes customer of product
→ Cash influx from sale
→ Retain codebase and platform
→ Buyer relationship continues

STAGE 5: Repeat in New Verticals
→ Launch new niche agency
→ Deploy existing platform with industry customizations
→ Fast market entry (no tech rebuild)
→ Compound learning and technology

Bottom callout: "Each agency pays for next product iteration"
```

**Slide Content:**

### Why Agency-First Works

**Traditional Product Risk:**
- Build something nobody wants
- Burn capital before finding product-market fit
- Theoretical feature debates
- Slow iteration cycles

**Agency-First Advantages:**
1. **Paid market research:** Clients fund your learning
2. **Real-world validation:** No theoretical debates - see what works
3. **Deep expertise:** Not surface-level understanding
4. **A/B testing at scale:** Try things with real users
5. **Capital efficiency:** Revenue from day one
6. **Lower risk:** Prove concepts before productizing

**The Exit Strategy:**
- Don't just sell the agency business - sell to someone who becomes a platform customer
- They get: established client base, proven processes, revenue stream
- We keep: codebase, platform IP, technical systems
- Example: Rising Ink agency sold → buyer uses Rising Ink platform for their clients
- Huge cash influx + ongoing platform revenue

**Cross-Industry Deployment:**
- Once platform built for tattoo industry, adapt to others
- DaySmart did this: DaySmart BodyArt is tattoo-specific version
- Launch new niche agency → deploy platform with industry customizations
- Compound effects: technology + expertise + customer base

**VISUAL CONCEPT 8: "Social Media Management Pilot - Elvis Experiment"**

```
[WORKFLOW DIAGRAM]

STEP 1: Content Capture
- InstaGo camera (auto-captures tattoo session video)
- AI creates story clips automatically
- Elvis voice records end-of-session notes

STEP 2: Upload & Process
- Content shared through easy interface (Airtable/no-code builder)
- AI pipelines process:
  - Video editing
  - Caption drafting
  - Hashtag suggestions
  - Story sequencing

STEP 3: Review & Publish
- First drafts ready for Elvis approval
- Light editing if needed
- Scheduled publishing
- Analytics tracking

STEP 4: Portfolio Integration
- Same content populates portfolio site
- Unified data model (content captured once, used everywhere)
- Client photos for sharing

Bottom note: "Pilot with Elvis → Summer 2025 → Product if successful"
Additional note: "Makes social media easy for artists who just want to tattoo"
```

**Slide Content:**

### Innovation Pipeline: Social Media as a Product

**The Elvis Pilot (Summer 2025):**
- **Problem:** Artists want portfolio visibility, hate social media management
- **Solution:** Make it dead simple
  - InstaGo camera: automatically captures video + creates story clips
  - Voice recording habit: end of each session, share with us
  - AI pipelines: process content, draft captions, create posts
  - Easy interface: artist approves/light edits, we publish

**Why This Could Be a Product:**
- Artists will upload portfolio items to the platform anyway
- Unified system: capture once, use everywhere (portfolio + social + client photos)
- High-touch service initially, extract automation patterns
- Subscription upsell: "Social media automation" tier

**The Testing Advantage:**
- Partnership with Elvis (mutually beneficial pricing)
- Real-world refinement before scaling
- Get paid to develop the product
- Artists willing to pay for this (time is money)

## SECTION 8: THE ALTERNATIVE TO VC FUNDING

**VISUAL CONCEPT 13: "YC Alternative Comparison"**

```
[SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON TABLE]

Y COMBINATOR PATH:
Timeline: 12-week intensive bootcamp
Funding: ~$500K for 7% equity
Who Gets Equity: Outside investors (not builders)
Outcome: Capital + expertise + network
Requirements: Accepted to program (highly selective)
Focus: Demo day pitch, raise next round
Risk: Dilution, investor pressure, growth expectations

RISING INK PATH:
Timeline: 6 months (similar intensity)
Funding: $1M from service revenue
Who Gets Equity: Team members building it
Outcome: Capital + retained control + proven market
Requirements: Execute on agency scale-up
Focus: Customer revenue, product development
Risk: Execution risk, but market validated

Center callout: "Same intensity, same timeline - but YOU get equity, not outside investors"
```

**Slide Content:**

### The Bootstrap Alternative

**Traditional Path (Y Combinator Model):**
- 12 weeks of intensive development
- Get funding from outside investors
- Give away equity to people not building
- Pressure to hit growth targets
- Demo day, next round, etc.

**Our Path:**
- 6 months to $1M revenue (similar intensity)
- Get funding from customer revenue
- Equity goes to people actually building
- Pressure to deliver for customers (who pay us)
- Product validated through market demand

**Why This Could Appeal to You:**
- **If you want to build cool shit:** We have the market, revenue, and momentum
- **If you want ownership:** Get equity by building, not by having capital
- **If you want control:** Customer-funded means less investor pressure
- **If you want to learn:** Real customers, real problems, real feedback

**What This Requires:**
- Rolling up sleeves for a few months
- Helping us get to $1M scale
- Building foundations for product
- Seeing if there's long-term alignment

**What This Could Become:**
- Equity in growing product company
- Technical co-founder role
- Ongoing creative input and ownership
- Share in upside as platform scales

**The Friendly Challenge:**
- This is exciting - what do you propose?
- Take some ownership of building something together
- We're on the precipice of $1M revenue
- You have the technical chops
- Andrew and I have the business/market side
- Let's see if there's something here
